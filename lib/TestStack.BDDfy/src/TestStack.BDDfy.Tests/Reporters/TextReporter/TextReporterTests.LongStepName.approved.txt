Scenario: Scenario Text
	Given a normal length title                                  [Not executed] 
	When something of normal length happens                      [Not executed] 
	Then some long state should be: #Title                       [Not executed] 

Some more stuff which is quite long on the second line

And finally another really long line
	  And a normal length assertion                              [Not executed]
