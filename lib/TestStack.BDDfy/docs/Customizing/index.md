# Customizing BDDfy
BDDfy strives to be very extensible: Its core barely has any logic in it all its responsibilities are delegated to extensions, all of which are configurable. For example,  if you don't like the reports it generates, you can write your custom reporter in a few lines of code.

This section will look at the extensibility points and provide samples of customizing BDDfy.
